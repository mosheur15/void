# 🌌 Void (.vd)

**Systems power with scripting simplicity.**

**Void** is a systems programming language designed to be as simple as a high-level scripting language while retaining the power of manual memory management.

## 🗺 Roadmap
- [x] **Phase 1: Lexer** (Current) - Raw source (.vd) → Token Stream.
- [ ] **Phase 2: Parser** - Token Stream → Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- [ ] **Phase 3: Type Checker** - Validates logic and infers missing types.
- [ ] **Phase 4: Backend** - Generates executable machine code.

## 🎯 The Void Philosophy
- **Familiar Syntax:** No "weird" symbols. If you know C, Python, or JS, you know Void.
- **Batteries Included:** High-level built-in methods (strings, arrays, maps) come standard.
- **Direct Control:** Manual memory management when you need it, without the boilerplate.
- **Smart Defaults:** Type inference is the standard; explicit typing is the exception.

## 🏗 Under Development

Void aims to eliminate the "complexity tax" of systems programming. It provides the performance of low-level languages with the ergonomics of high-level ones.

```javascript
function main() {
    // Type inference handles the heavy lifting
    let message = "Void is alive"
    print(message)
}
```

## 🪄 Looks familiar, right?

That’s the point. Void removes the friction between thinking and coding. You get the safety and control of a systems language without having to learn a cryptic new dialect.
